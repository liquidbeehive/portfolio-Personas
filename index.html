        <h2>Context</h2>
        As a graphic designer for my school's LGBTQ Center that also wanted to delve deeper into brand redesign, I came across <a href="https://www.pointofpride.org/">Point of Pride</a>, an organization that helps provide medical and gender-affirming care to trans people in order to give them the support (emotional or financial) that they don't have in order to empower them. 
        This was especially relevant in 2023 (and today), when many trans kids around the US are being denied their right to gender-affirming care. 
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="screenshot of Point of Pride website" src="photos/pointofpride-original.png"/>
        </p>
        The organization already had a solid, consistent color scheme and brand; however, I was interested in finding ways to not only make the website more distinct but also more inviting and approachable. 
        <h2>Logo Development</h2>
        <p>
            Because Point of Pride is involved in providing support for various medical procedures, I wanted to ensure my logo designs presented them as dependable and respectable. 
            However, I also wanted to highlight their empathic and uplifting mission goals as an organization, especially towards trans youth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="rough sketches of initial logos" src="photos/roughdraft1.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            After some sketching, I liked the metaphor of a butterfly (signifying transformation) and a hand (signifying warmth and care), and focused my designs around those visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="rough sketches of initial hand logos" src="photos/roughdraft2.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting some feedback from peers, I leaned towards the logo of the outstretched finger, not only because of its simple geometric design but also how the finger seemed to be pointing, as a reference to "Point" of Pride.
        </p>
        Now that I had a better understanding of where I wanted to go, it was time to refine the logo.
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="defined logos" src="photos/logo.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="defined logos" src="photos/logo2.png"/>
        </p>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to have a bright and colorful palette with a subtle reference to the trans flag, alongside some simple yet fun and distinct typography.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="PoP color scheme" src="photos/colorscheme.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="PoP typography" src="photos/typography.png"/>
        </p>
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>
            To see how this design could be implemented in various real-life products, I designed a few ways in which this design could manifest.
        </p>
        <i>Illustrations & Social Media Mockups</i>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="PoP illustrations" src="photos/illustrations.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="PoP social media" src="photos/socialmedia.png"/>
        </p>
        <i>Packaging</i>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="PoP packaging mockup" src="photos/binderpackaging.png"/>
        </p>
        <i>Subway Ad Mockups</i>
        <p>
            <img class = "photo" alt="PoP subway ad mockups" src="photos/subwayadmockup.png"/>
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Going in to the redesign, I knew I wanted to create a distinct color palette and design scheme that helped 
            provide Point of Pride a strong visual brand. But I wanted to balance the feeling of the uplifting and joyful nature of trans pride and gender euphoria while
            also maintaining a sense of respect and professionality in respect to the many medical and financial procedures 
            Point of Pride is involved in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I realised the importance of not only creating an aesthetic brand, but also intentionally considering the intended message and 
            the audience interpretation.
